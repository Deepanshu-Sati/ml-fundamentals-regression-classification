# Machine Learning Fundamentals: Regression & Classification

This repository contains **foundational machine learning models implemented in Python**, focusing on core ideas behind **regression and binary classification**. The objective of this project is to build strong intuition for how classical ML algorithms work by implementing them from first principles rather than relying on black-box libraries.

The work emphasizes:

* Mathematical formulation of models
* Gradient-based optimization
* Clean, readable, and reproducible Python code

This project was developed as part of independent learning and is intended to support applications for **research-oriented internships and academic projects**.

## Implemented Models

### 1. Linear Regression (from scratch)

* Single-variable linear regression
* Mean squared error cost function
* Batch gradient descent optimization
* Visualization of training data and fitted regression line

**Concepts covered:**
Cost functions, gradient descent, parameter convergence

---

### 2. Logistic Regression (from scratch)

* Binary classification using logistic regression
* Sigmoid activation and cross-entropy loss
* Gradient descent–based optimization
* Feature mapping for non-linear decision boundaries
* L2 regularization to reduce overfitting

**Concepts covered:**
Classification, regularization, bias–variance tradeoff
